        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Over the last 3 years, I have been practicing creating games in Unity and Unreal Engine. 
            In high school I took two computer science classes teaching Python 3 and Java. 
            Throughout the month of January of 2020, I have been developing my own game called Space Outlaw, 
            this project was mainly to test my skills in the Unity engine. I then followed up afterwords with projects like The Butterfly Effect 
            and Project Hole until I published my first game to iOS and Android, Color Fracture. Right now I am working on a multiplayer mobile game called The Darkening. 
            I am also very savvy with computers with nearly 10 years of experience. I have had my own computer since I was young and always maintained and fixed problems 
            that presented itself. I also have helped build and set up computers for friends.
            <br>
            Color Fracture is available on both <em>
